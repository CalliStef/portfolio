I believe a portfolio should not only showcase my projects, but also reflect my personality. With this in mind, I have designed a website that is personal and welcoming to visitors. The immersive home layout creates an interactive experience for users, allowing them to feel a sense of relatability as they explore my projects. 

While I still have many plans for this portfolio. I invite you to visit my website and explore my work to get to know me better!
